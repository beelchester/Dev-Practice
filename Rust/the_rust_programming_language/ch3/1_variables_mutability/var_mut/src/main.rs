/*
 again, by default variables in Rust are immutable, this provides safety and concurrency
concurrency means that multiple parts of your program can execute independently from each other at the same time

to make a variable mutable, you must use the mut keyword

constants are similar to immutable variables, but there are a few differences
1. you aren't allowed to use mut with constants
2. you declare constants using the const keyword instead of let
3. constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope which makes them useful for values that many parts of the program need to know about
Immutable variables are scoped to the block in which they are defined
4. constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a function call or any other value that could only be computed at runtime,  In other words, when you define a constant, its value should be known at the time of compilation, and it should not depend on any runtime calculations or operations.
Immutable variables can be assigned a value at runtime
5. Immutable variables can have their type inferred by the compiler, while constants must have a specified type.
naming conventions
// immutable variable
let my_variable_name = 42;

// constant
const MY_CONSTANT_NAME: u32 = 1000;

Naming hardcoded values used throughout your program as constants is useful in conveying the meaning of that value to future maintainers of the code. It also helps to have only one place in your code you would need to change if the hardcoded value needed to be updated in the future.

shadowing a variable means redefining the same variable name with a new value, effectively hiding the previous value. it happens within a scope

Shadowing a variable is different from marking a variable as mutable (mut) because it allows us to reassign a new value to the variable, while still retaining the immutability of the original variable. In contrast, if we declare a variable as mutable with mut, we can directly reassign a new value to that variable without using the let keyword.
