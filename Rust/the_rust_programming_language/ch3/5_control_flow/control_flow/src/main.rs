/*
control flow: ability to run some code conditionally or repeatedly
if expressions and loops
the block of  code to be executed after the condition is wrapped in curly brackets {} and is called arms of the if expression just like arms in match used in ch2
else statement is optional and if not provided and the condition is false, the program will just skip the if block and move to the next statement
the condition must be a bool
rust will not automatically try to convert non-boolean types to a boolean, so give a boolean expression explicitly

else if: multiple conditions can be checked using else if
if multiple conditions are true, the first block of code that matches will be executed and the rest will be ignored
else if can cause clutter, so when you have many conditions, match expression is better in rust

if can be used in let also

Knowing the type of number (check commented number variable) lets the compiler verify the type is valid everywhere we use number. Rust wouldnâ€™t be able to do that if the type of number was only determined at runtime; the compiler would be more complex and would make fewer guarantees about the code if it had to keep track of multiple hypothetical types for any variable.

loops

The loop keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.

break statement can be used to stop the loop
continue statement can be used to skip the rest of the iteration and start a new one
loops can also return values using break
If you have loops within loops, break and continue apply to the innermost loop at that point.
loop labels can be used to break or continue the outer loop from the inner loop

evaluating within the loop and breaking if some condition can be done using loop, if, else and break, instead of this while loop can also be used

safety and conciseness of for loop makes it most used loop in rust
